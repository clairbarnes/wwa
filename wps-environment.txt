To set up conda environment for WPS to access data on ESGF servers:

conda create --name wps -y
conda activate wps

conda install esgf-pyclient defusedxml MyProxyClient dask xarray matplotlib ipykernel netcdf4 -y

conda install ipykernel -y
ipython kernel install --user --name=wps




# could probably do with modifying this to use xclim, xesmf, regionmask, geopandas etc - but this may require removing the environment & reconstructing from scratch (think xesmf may need to be installed before other packages?)

# had to reinstall netcdf4 in order to actually open data for some reason
